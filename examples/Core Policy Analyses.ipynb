    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a core set of analysis on a policy, primary focused on least-privilege and system self-protection. This is geared towards systems that have a customized SELinux policy based upon reference policy (and usually a RHEL or Fedora derivative).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Replace the policies loaded with the system policies that you are interested in.\n",
    "   * Run each analysis and examine the output - this notebook doesn't give you yes/no answers. It requires interpretation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "# Getting the Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these notebook you need the source and binary versions of two policies: the system and base policy. Base policy, here, meaning the policy that the system developers started with. This is typically the policy from the version of RHEL or Fedora that the system is based upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "System developers typically either add policy modules, directly modify the base policy, or both. Regardless of the approach, it's nice to have the base policy in both source and binary form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the source and binary policies for the system is dependent on how the system is developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get the source for the base policy is to start with the source for selinux-policy. You can grab those from:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * http://vault.centos.org/\n",
    "   * http://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/updates/\n",
    "   \n",
    "Once you have the source rpm, you need to at least partially build it so that all of the patches are applied. First setup your system to build rpms - there is some info at https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/RebuildSRPM. From there, just rpmbuild -bp will output the patched source to ~/rpmbuild/BUILD.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also build the binary policy this way, but it's actually kind of pain. It's easier to just grab the rpm and extract it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`rpm2cpio selinux-policy-targeted-3.13.1-190.fc24.noarch.rpm | cpio -idmv`\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have done this, the policy should be under etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.30 (or similar) in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've collected the policies, simply save the source and binaries under the same directory with this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import and load the policies\n",
    "\n",
    "You should change policy_paths.config to match the policies that you want to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example for this notebook, we are going to use a Fedora 25 policy as the system policy and a Fedora 24 policy as the base policy."
