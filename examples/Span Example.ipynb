    "Jupyter notebooks are an interactive environment that let's us write text (in Markdown) and code together. What's powerful is that the code is executable (unless you are viewing this on the web in a read-only mode). That let's you write queries and text together at the same time. You can get a feel for what's possible in this awesome notebook on [Regex Golf from XKCD](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313.ipynb). There is also the more official (and boring) [introduction](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
